    "\n",
    "#### What problems do an airline face?\n",
    "\n",
    "1: There are 5000 airlines currently operating. This means relative to other industries there has been little consolidation so competition for passangers is fierce.\n",
    "2: Flyers have significant choice on which airline to fly with.\n",
    "3: COVID restrictions and labour shortages have made operating airlines even more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do airlines need to know about customer satisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "1: There is limited capital to invest.\n",
    "2: Airlines want to know what to invest in with regards to retaining existing customers whilst attracting new ones.\n",
    "3: Airlines want to know which customers to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does this project aim to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it's deciding on what refreshments to offer or how much to invest in the online booking process, this project mimicks the type of analysis a data scientist would conduct to answer these types of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where is the data from?\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is sourced from John.D on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is reportadley from an airline survery, though the exact source is not shared. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means the data suffers the general disadvantages of survery data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Valuable data is missing from individuals who did not fill in the survery which could contradict our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: The data provided is what individuals believe their satisfaction to be is, but this may not represent their true satisfaction."
