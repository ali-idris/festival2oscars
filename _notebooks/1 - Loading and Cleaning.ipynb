    "#### What problems do an airline face?\n",
    "\n",
    "1: There are 5000 airlines currently operating. This means relative to other industries there has been little consolidation so competition for passangers is fierce.\n",
    "2: Flyers have significant choice on which airline to fly with.\n",
    "3: COVID restrictions and labour shortages have made operating airlines even more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do airlines need to know about customer satisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "1: There is limited capital to invest.\n",
    "2: Airlines want to know what to invest in with regards to retaining existing customers whilst attracting new ones.\n",
    "3: Airlines want to know which customers to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does this project aim to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it's deciding on what refreshments to offer or how much to invest in the online booking process, this project mimicks the type of analysis a data scientist would conduct to answer these types of questions. Ultimately, the aim is to enable data driven decison making to cut costs and increase revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who would make use of this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I was to build out this project from an MVP to a fully fledged software, it would be used by business stakeholders at airlines to input a data file full of satisfaction ratings from customers and would export:\n",
    "- What to focus on in detail\n",
    "- What not to focus on in detail\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights would be communicated to senior stakeholders who would be able to make better data driven decisons.\n",

    "#### Where is the data from?\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is sourced from John.D on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is reportadley from an airline survery, though the exact source is not shared. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was extremely easy to acquire since it was on an easy to use website (Kaggle) and was a simple one click download. I wouldn't require any data acquisiton adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the data suffers the general disadvantages of survery data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Valuable data is missing from individuals who did not fill in the survery which could contradict our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: The data provided is what individuals believe their satisfaction to be is, but this may not represent their true satisfaction.\n",
