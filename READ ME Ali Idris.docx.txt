Hi.


I’m Ali

To graduate from the BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp, I am submitting my capstone presentation. My project looks to answer the question:  What factors lead to customer satisfaction for an Airline?

In this project I
1: Use data cleaning & visualisation techniques to prepare and understand the dataset
2: Use machine learning techniques to build models and extract data-driven insights I can use to answer the core question
3: Communicate as concisely as possible whilst always keeping the core question in mind

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction


The notebooks in this submission are as follows. They sit in the ‘notebooks’ folder:
1: 1 - Loading and Cleaning
2: 2 - EDA & Pre Processing
3: 3 - Modelling


Additionally, the data can be found in the ‘data’ folder
1: satisfaction_2015.xlsx (required for notebook 1)
2: cleaned_airlines.csv  (required for notebook 2)
3: cleaned_airlines2.csv  (required for notebook 3)

Thank you for your time.
